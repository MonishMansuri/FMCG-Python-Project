# FMCG-Python-Project

- I used PANADA Library for creating this project

To gain insights into the sales performance of an FMCG company by analyzing various
aspects such as monthly quantities sold, category-wise quantities, sub-channel sales, peak
sales months, best-selling products, and the range of products offered.
